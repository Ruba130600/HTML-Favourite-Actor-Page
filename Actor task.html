   <h5>Sivakarthikeyan (born 17 February 1985[4]) is an Indian actor, singer, film producer, lyricist, and television presenter, who works predominantly in Tamil films.

      He produces films under his production company, Sivakarthikeyan Productions.During college, Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural events and performed mimicry and stand-up comedy on stage.[6] Between his studies he took three months break and during this period his friends convinced him to go for auditions of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru, a reality show for comedy aired on Star Vijay. He started his career as a mimicry artist. Despite initial reluctance to participate, he won the show.[7] He appeared in short films including his friend Atlee's Mugapputhagam,[8] Identity, Kurahl 786 and 360Â°. The makers of Aegan noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a supporting role, but his portions didn't make the final cut.[9]

      Director Pandiraj approached him to play the lead role in his film Marina and Sivakarthikeyan signed the project. He prepared for his first role by paying close attention to Pandiraj's instructions and visiting Marina Beach extensively to study the surroundings, while revealing that he hoped that his natural talent of humour would come through on-screen.[10] Featuring alongside Oviya as a young couple in the film, Siva's performance was well received with a critic noting "the romance adds color to a monochrome film", while the reviewer also noted that the "role of Senthilnathan requires Siva to be just himself, it is just a cake walk in terms of performance for this actor."</h5>
